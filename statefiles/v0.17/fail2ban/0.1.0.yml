  About: Deploy a Fail2ban server using LinuxServer.io image.
  LongAbout: |
    Fail2ban is an intrusion prevention software framework that protects computer servers from brute-force attacks.
    It monitors log files and bans IPs that show malicious signs, such as too many password failures, seeking for exploits, etc.
    Generally, Fail2ban is used to update firewall rules to reject the IP addresses for a specified amount of time,
    although any arbitrary other action (e.g., sending an email) can also be configured.

    This cargo uses the popular LinuxServer.io fail2ban image.

    By default, it will protect SSH access. You can uncomment other services in the `jail.local` file created at first run in the config path you provided.
